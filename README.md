# Parrot - Discord Bot
A multi purpose discord bot that can do many stuff like Moderation, Economy, and Music and other fun commands. Most of the bot codes are contributed from many other developers.

Bot is completely free to use and edit. So do not worry about anything. Let me know if you found any error in it.

I made this bot for testing my skills. Bot is completely written in `discord.py` module. Do add some other features. I will like that. This bot is made considering that you are very beginner to `discord.py`. So before changing anything do check the documentation.

You can [test my bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=800780974274248764&permissions=8&scope=bot) or you can self host it. Consider staring the project. I will feel good. 

All kind of strorage and configs are done in `.json` file. If you are self hosting this bot and your server is having good amount of members then I recommend you to use database, like [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). 

The bot will work fine with 1000-10,000 members, I guess. For any help and support consider asking me out either via my [Email](mailto:ritik0ranjan@gmail.com) or join my [Discord Server](discord.gg/NEyJxM7G7f).

### How?

Best and free way to host this bot is from [repl.it](http://repl.it "repl.it"). First you need to make a bot in [Discord Developer Portal](http://discord.com/developers/). Make a bot there. Grab the bot token. Fire the repl.it. Make a new application clone this repo. Paste the bot token in `.env` file. Run the bot (You can do changes in the code). Then you will get the link somelike like, `https://PROJECT_NAME.REPL_USERNAME.repl.co`. Keep pinging this site (about in every 10-15 mins) with [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/). 

I know you have not understood what I mean. So, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPTfmiYiuok) video tutorial. Thank you Beau Carnes for making this tutorial.

### Extra
My name is Ritik (beginner developer) and to be honest this is actually my first repo.
